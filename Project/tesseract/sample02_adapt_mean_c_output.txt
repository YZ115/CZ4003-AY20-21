O dear Lena, your beauty Ia oo vant

Iv is hard soinetimes to deacribe It feat.

L thought the entice world T would impress
Lf onty your portrait [ couk! compress.

Alas! Fit when I tried la use ¥Q

L found that your cheeks belong to only you.
Your ailky bait contains a thousand linea
Hart to match with uma of discrete cosines.
And for your Lipa, sensu and tactual
Thirteen Crays found not the proper fractal,
Ant while theee arthacks are all quite severe
I might bave fixed them with hacks bere or there
But when filters Look sparkle from your eyes
J avid, ‘Damo all thin, I'll Just digitize.”
